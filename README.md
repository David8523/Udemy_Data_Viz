## 1. Python and Tableau: The Complete Data Analytics Bootcamp!
in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-tableau-the-complete-data-analytics-bootcamp/) I did 3 projects that combine Python and Tableau 

### [Project 1:](https://github.com/David8523/Udemy_projects/blob/main/Sales_Analysis_for_Value_Inc.ipynb) Sales Analysis for Value Inc

I used Python to clean the data and used popular libraries like pandas to work with dataframes, perform calculations and much more. Then extract that data to Tableau to create calculations, parameters and develop a dashboard for the sales manager.

### [Project 2:](https://github.com/David8523/Udemy_projects/blob/main/Blue_Bank_Loan_Info.ipynb) Loan Analysis for Blue Bank

I learned how to read JSON files, work with lists, dictionaries, Numpy and if statements. I also learned how to do exceptions, for loops and plots in Python. Once that's done, I extracted the data to Tableau and build charts, work with Tableau Calculations and create an interactive dashboard.

### [Project 3:](https://github.com/David8523/Udemy_projects/blob/main/BlogMe_Sentiment_and_Keyword_Analysis.ipynb) Sentiment and Keyword Analysis for BlogMe

Here, I used a Natural Language Processing Library called Vader, that can extract sentiment on Python. I also learned about functions and classes on Python. Once we extract the data to Tableau, I performed Tableau Joins, work with sets and context filtering and finally create an interactive dashboard
